      <p class="tax_meaning">
        Taxation is the imposition of compulsory levies on individuals or
        entities by governments in almost every country of the world. Taxation
        is used primarily to raise revenue for government expenditures, though
        it can serve other purposes as well.

        Pre-Colonial Era
        <br>
        Before the arrival of the Spaniards, the nation had several barangays, or kingdoms, that were ruled by datus (or rajahs in some regions), who provided protection to all its subjects. Since barter was the primary method of exchange at the time, taxes, also known as buwis or handug (with the variant handog), took the form of goods or harvests that the inhabitants of the datu shared in exchange for security and protection. The highest and lowest castes were excused from paying taxes since only the timawa (free males) could provide protection because the datu and maharlikas (nobility) provided it and the oripun or uripon (slaves) lived only to serve.

       <p>Spanish Era
         <br>
        The Contador de Resultas was the Chief Royal Accountant during the 17th and 18th centuries, and his duties were comparable to those of the Commissioner of Internal Revenue today. He served as the Chief Arbitrator, whose financial rulings were binding unless overturned by the Council of Indies. Indirect taxes on tobacco, alcohol, cockpits, burlas, and powder were some of the taxes that were levied on the populace, in addition to a tribute or head tax of one gold maiz per year and taxes on the value of jewels and gold trinkets. The tributo, which was once worth between 8 and 10 reales, is one of the taxes that date back to the Spanish Empire. Another system for paying taxes was polo y servicio or forced labor. Spain eventually replaced tributo with cedula, allowing them to keep track of the people who were able to pay taxes. Another way the Filipinos were taxed was through the encomienda system, which grants land ownership to deserving peninsulares. Other local taxes included the donativo de Zamboanga, which was levied expressly for the conquest of Jolo, and the vinta, which was paid by residents of the provinces along Western Luzon's coast to protect the region against the then-common Muslim pirates.

        <br>

        <br><br>
        July 2, 1904:
        <br>
        Reorganization Act No. 1189, which was passed, resulted in the establishment of the Bureau of Internal Revenue (BIR).
        <br><br>
        1 August 1904:
        <br>
        The BIR was formally established and brought online.
        All national internal revenue taxes, fees, and charges must be assessed and collected by the agency in accordance with the legislation.
        <br><br>

        The Internal Revenue Law of 1904, which included taxes on banks, licenses, and excise charges Stamp taxes, cedula, insurance company taxes, taxes on forest products, taxes on mining concessions, taxes on businesses, and licenses for occupations.
        <br><br>
        1907:
        <br>
        Cedula and industry tax modifications the cedula under the new law underwent modifications because the rate was fixed per adult male. It was permitted in some locations to double the cedula charge. Industry tax was collected.
        The National Assembly of the Philippines eliminated the cedula tax due to the hardship it places on the country's poor.
        <br>
        Every Filipino citizen over the age of eighteen who has held a normal job with a wage or compensation, as well as every corporation, regardless of how it was founded or organized, is liable for residence tax. The following individuals are exempt: the US high commissioner and members of his staff; officers and enlisted personnel of the US army and navy; representatives and officials of foreign governments; and transient visitors staying in the Philippines for less than three months.
